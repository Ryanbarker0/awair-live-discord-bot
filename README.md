# Awair Discord Bot

This bot pulls live data from my Awair element and sends it to discord via the authenticated bot.

To login as the bot create a `.env` file and add a `TOKEN` and `API_KEY`.

`TOKEN` is the token the bot uses to create the session with Discord.
`API_KEY` is the Awair developers API key.

To login as the bot use:

```
node index.js
```
